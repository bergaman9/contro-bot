## Contro Bot

This is a Discord bot that I made for my own server. It's a work in progress, but it's functional. It's written in Python using the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) library.

### Features

- **Welcome Images**: When a new user joins the server, the bot will send a welcome image to the channel specified in the config file.
- **Music**: Play music from YouTube and Spotify in voice channels.
