## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in CONTRO Bot, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
- Security vulnerabilities should not be disclosed publicly until they are fixed
- This protects users who are running the bot

### 2. Send a private report
- Email: [security@yourproject.com] (replace with your contact)
- Include:
  - Description of the vulnerability
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Potential impact
  - Any suggested fixes

### 3. Response timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: Within 24-48 hours
  - High: Within 1 week
  - Medium: Within 2 weeks
  - Low: Within 1 month

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Environment Variables**: Always use `.env` files for sensitive data
2. **Bot Permissions**: Only grant necessary Discord permissions
3. **Database Security**: Secure your MongoDB instance
4. **Updates**: Keep the bot updated to the latest version
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor bot logs for suspicious activity

### For Contributors
1. **Code Review**: All code changes require review
2. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
5. **Logging**: Log security events but not sensitive data

## Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against API abuse
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling without information disclosure
- **Database Security**: Parameterized queries prevent injection attacks
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Permission Checks**: Proper Discord permission validation

## Known Security Considerations

1. **Bot Token**: Never commit bot tokens to version control
2. **Database Access**: Secure MongoDB with authentication
3. **API Keys**: Use environment variables for all API keys
4. **User Data**: Minimal user data collection and proper handling
5. **Logging**: Sensitive data is never logged

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

When a security vulnerability is reported and confirmed:

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Initial response and assessment
3. **Day 3-7**: Fix development and testing
4. **Day 7-14**: Fix deployment and verification
5. **Day 14+**: Public disclosure (if appropriate)
