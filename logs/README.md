# Bot Logs Directory

This folder contains log files generated by the Discord bot:

- `bot_YYYY-MM-DD.log` - Main bot logs with timestamps, info, warnings, and errors
- `discord_YYYY-MM-DD.log` - Discord API specific logs
- `heartbeat.log` - Updated regularly while bot is running, helps determine if bot is alive

## Understanding Log Files

### Main Log Format
Entries follow this format:
```
2023-11-25 14:32:15 - INFO - Bot is starting up
```

### Log Levels:
- INFO: Normal operational messages
- WARNING: Something unexpected but not critical
- ERROR: Something failed but the bot can continue
- CRITICAL: Major issue that might cause the bot to stop

### When Bot Crashes
Check for CRITICAL or ERROR entries just before the logs stop. 
These usually indicate what caused the bot to stop working.

### Common Issues:
- Discord API errors (rate limits, permissions)
- Uncaught exceptions in event handlers
- Network connectivity issues
- Memory/CPU resource exhaustion
