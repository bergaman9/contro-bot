1. **Welcome System** (`/src/cogs/community/welcome.py`)
   - Welcome message configuration
   - Goodbye message configuration
   - Image generation with customization
   - Channel and role settings

2. **Leveling System** (`/src/cogs/community/leveling.py`)
   - XP gain on messages
   - Level roles and rewards
   - Leaderboard commands
   - Rank cards

3. **Registration System** (`/src/cogs/community/registration.py`)
   - User registration flow
   - Role assignment
   - Verification system

#### Fun Commands
1. **Games** (`/src/cogs/fun/games.py`)
   - Mini-games and entertainment
   - Social commands

2. **Giveaways** (`/src/cogs/fun/giveaways.py`)
   - Giveaway creation and management
   - Winner selection

3. **Spin Wheel** (`/src/cogs/fun/spin.py`)
   - Spin wheel with rewards

#### Admin Commands
1. **Bot Management** (`/src/cogs/admin/bot_management.py`)
   - Bot status and configuration
   - Performance monitoring

2. **Server Setup** (`/src/cogs/admin/server_setup.py`)
   - Initial server configuration
   - Template application

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data, business logic, and presentation
2. **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
4. **Maintainability**: Organized structure makes code easier to understand and modify
5. **MongoDB Native**: Leverages MongoDB's document-based structure and operators

## Migration Notes

- All old cog files have been moved to their new locations
- Original file structure preserved as backup in moved files
- Import paths need to be updated in moved files
- Configuration files centralized in `/src/config/`
- Resources (images, data, fonts) organized under `/resources/`

## Next Steps

1. Update import paths in all moved cog files
2. Implement remaining community commands
3. Test migrated commands for functionality
4. Add error handling and logging to new commands
5. Create unit tests for critical components

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Modular Architecture**: Separate concerns into clear, maintainable modules
2. **Scalability**: Design for future growth and feature additions
3. **Best Practices**: Follow Python and Discord.py community standards
4. **Developer Experience**: Easy onboarding and clear code organization
